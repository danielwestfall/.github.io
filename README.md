# Daniel Westfall's Portfolio
___

Coming soon - Portfolio v2.0 - Check out my Figma Design file [here](https://www.figma.com/file/k49aOd0WWnTTtrfdmtDlWF/NewPortfolio?node-id=0%3A1)

This is where I will catalog my projects and assignments for my classes in the MIT xPRO Full Stack Development Boot Camp. I will be adding projects 
that showcase the things I've learned to do for potential employers, as well as creating a collection of code I have written and can continuously improve upon.<br>

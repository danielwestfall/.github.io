# Daniel Westfall's Portfolio
___

Coming soon - Portfolio v2.0 - The current site is my bootcamp projects, results of assignments and in the coming future will be updated with my current passion, creating accessible experiences using WCAG guidelines, Section 508 testing, and creative approaches and problem solving to make the web a better place for us all. 

<br>

Initially this site will be renovated and made accessible first, then the old project will be removed and replaced with my current projects.
